# plan and readme

what i want to make is a program that simulates Reaction-Diffusion by following <https://www.karlsims.com/rd.html>  

this will be able to:

- support large grid sizes
- add colour to the images automatically
- save its output as individual frames

if possible it should be able to:

- monitor the time between frames / full simulations
- allow easy changes to the exact rates without needing to recompile
- allow screen video output
- allow easy starting configuration changes
- allow images to be inputted as a starting configuration - will need to be converted to gray scale
- allow the option for screen wrapping as needed
- allow dynamic painting
- allow GPU usage

notes:

- all A starting, B feeds in
